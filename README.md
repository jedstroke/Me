<code>[Everything I Do Is For Joan](https://loml.jedshock.com/)</code>

I am an innovative and diligent individual aspiring to contribute to a purpose larger than life. Employing a scientific approach, I tackle problems optimally and ensure every pixel is aesthetically aligned. I take responsibility for every unnoticed or noticed bug, striving to deliver my very best while wearing various hats. I am Jedidiah Gabriel, a lifelong learner, and a software engineer. 

### JSYK:
The projects pinned might not be very React idiomatic, or have your ideal React directory structure because I was keen on the results & once wrote bad code.
