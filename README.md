# Jedidiah Gabriel 👋🏼

[Everything I Do Is For Joan](https://joan.onrender.com)
I am an innovative and hardworking young man who hopes to live for a cause bigger than life, with a scientific approach to solving problems in the most optimal way, and guiding every pixel aesthetically & never letting them go astray.
